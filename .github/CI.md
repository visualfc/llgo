# Shared CI policy

Workflows call `ci-prepare.yml` as their `prepare` job. Its outputs are job
outputs, not environment variables: consumers declare `needs: prepare` and use
`needs.prepare.outputs.run_code_ci == 'true'` or
`needs.prepare.outputs.run_doc_checks == 'true'`. Existing artifact dependencies
must stay in `needs` alongside `prepare`.

The implementation is in `scripts/ci_policy.py`. Keep change rules there rather
than adding path filters or independent diff commands to individual workflows.
Each workflow executes its own small prepare job; the rule implementation is
shared. The prepare job needs only Git and Python, not the LLGo toolchain. On a
PR, it loads both `ci_policy.py` and `ci_changes.py` from the event's base
commit, so edits to those modules in the PR cannot change this step's skip
decision. If either base file is unavailable (including before this policy lands
on main), prepare enables both suites. Main, tags and manual runs execute the
checked-out policy and enable both suites.

## Execution decisions

- Only `pull_request` runs may skip checks. Pushes to main, tag builds, scheduled
  runs and manual runs enable both outputs without inspecting a diff. This does
  not add new triggers to schedule-only workflows or enable tag-only publishing
  on branches.
- A PR is compared from the merge base of its event base/head SHAs to its head,
  including every commit and every changed path. Changes subsequently pushed to
  the base branch do not alter that comparison.
- Added/modified, regular non-executable `.md`, `.markdown` and `.rst` files are
  prose. Other extensions and unknown paths require code CI. `doc/_readme/**`
  and `testdata` directories are code/test inputs even when named Markdown.
- Documentation changes, README example inputs and `.github/**` changes enable
  document checks. The existing check still verifies README embedded sources
  and README links; this policy does not expand its scanning scope.
- Deletions, renames and type changes run both suites because they can remove
  linked files or packaged documents. Unavailable or invalid PR diffs also run
  both suites, with a warning. An empty diff is handled conservatively.
- The **Docs** workflow installs LLGo and executes examples, so it consumes
  `run_code_ci`, not `run_doc_checks`.

Prepare also exports `pr_head_sha` and `pr_merge_base` for benchmark consumers.
These are empty on non-PR events. If PR Git history cannot be resolved, code CI
is enabled but benchmark consumers must reject an empty merge base rather than
silently measuring a different commit.

## Runners and concurrency

`linux_runner` and `linux_large_runner` contain JSON runner labels. The upstream
`xgo-dev` repository uses its qiniu runners; workflows running in forks use
GitHub-hosted Ubuntu 24.04. Consume them with `fromJSON(...)`. Public-network
link checks and release packaging keep their explicitly selected hosted runners.
Windows and macOS platform matrices remain in their owning workflows.

PR updates share a concurrency group and cancel superseded runs. Main and tag
runs use `github.run_id` in their group so later commits neither cancel running
checks nor replace pending checks. Workflow-level concurrency cannot consume
prepare outputs; `test_ci_workflows.py` enforces the common expression instead.
The reusable prepare workflow has no concurrency group of its own.

Every workflow that uses prepare has a uniquely named `CI gate (...)` job. It
runs even if prepare fails and reports that failure. Branch protection should
require the gates for PR workflows, the relevant code/document checks, and
**CI policy**. Requiring only downstream jobs does not distinguish a prepare
failure from an intentional docs-only skip. The gate checks preparation, not
the result of every downstream job; it does not replace those required checks.

The benchmark publisher checks the triggering run's artifacts separately for
native and WASM results before invoking either publisher. A successful docs-only
run has no benchmark artifacts and is a normal no-op. External benchmark
notifications run for every upstream main push, including documentation changes.

## Validation

The independent **CI policy** workflow runs on every PR and main push. It tests
Git histories, failure fallbacks, runner selection, output propagation, matrix
coverage, release dependencies, main concurrency, and missing benchmark artifacts.
It is deliberately not gated by the code it validates.

Locally, install `scripts/requirements-ci.txt` in a Python environment and run:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s .github/scripts -p 'test_*.py' -v
actionlint -shellcheck= .github/workflows/*.yml
```
