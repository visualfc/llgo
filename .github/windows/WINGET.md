# Preparing WinGet manifests

The Windows release pipeline builds and tests four ABI/architecture variants as ZIP archives. ZIP directory records are stored without compression, because WinGet's pure ZIP checker rejects directory entries with nonzero compressed data. `release_zip.py` compares every file and directory against the staging tree when building the ZIP and verifies the extracted contents during artifact tests; `test-release.ps1` executes the ZIP's compiler before and after native dependencies are installed.

The `prepare-winget` job emits the `llgo-winget-candidates` workflow artifact only after all Windows artifact tests pass. It does not upload release assets or submit a winget-pkgs PR. The candidates use two proposed package IDs, `XGo.LLGo.MSVC` and `XGo.LLGo.MinGW`, each with x64 and ARM64 installers. Review the IDs before the initial public submission. Both expose `llgo`, so users should select one ABI profile on PATH.

To prepare the same candidates locally with Python 3.11 or newer:

```sh
python .github/windows/prepare-winget.py \
  --artifacts .windows-dist --version 1.2.3 --output .winget
```

`1.2.3` is an example: use the actual release version without `v`. The input directory must contain all four `llgo<VERSION>.windows-{amd64,arm64}-{msvc,mingw}.zip` files and their `.zip.sha256` sidecars. The generator hashes the actual ZIP bytes, checks release version/architecture/ABI metadata, requires a common source commit, and emits standard version/installer/defaultLocale YAML files. The public installer URLs point to the matching `v<VERSION>` GitHub release.

Before submitting to [microsoft/winget-pkgs](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs):

1. Publish the tested ZIPs through the normal tag release. Confirm every public URL serves the bytes whose hashes appear in the candidates. PR/snapshot artifacts alone do not establish that those URLs exist.
2. Run `winget validate --manifest <version-directory>` for each profile, then test real installation, command startup, upgrade, and uninstall on a clean Windows environment. Keep WinGet's archive and hash checks enabled.
3. Submit the reviewed `manifests/x/XGo/LLGo/...` directories. Candidate package IDs and public-source upgrade behavior still require initial publication review.

The MinGW installer manifest sets `ArchiveBinariesDependOnPath: true`; MSVC retains the portable alias. Both point at `bin/llgo.exe` and include the external dependency notes from [WINDOWS.md](../../WINDOWS.md). No complete SDK/toolchain bundle is implied.

Do not copy local validation `ProductCode` values ending in `__DefaultSource` into public manifests. A synthetic packaging upgrade using unchanged compiler bytes validates only the local lifecycle. In the local WinGet 1.29.290 test, upgrading a portable package moved it from the custom location to WinGet's default location; do not promise custom-location preservation from that test.
