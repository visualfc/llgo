# Link-phase ftab/findfunctab generation

Status: design + staged plan. Depends on #2012 (runtime funcinfo find index)
and benefits from #2015 (nanosecond monotonic clock, for honest benchmarks).

## Problem

#2012 builds the sorted function-entry table and the Go-style findfunctab at
**first use in the running process**, because LLVM IR generation does not know
final linked text order. This leaves four measured gaps against Go 1.26:

1. `cold.FirstFuncForPC`: 36µs on macOS / 12µs on Linux vs Go's 2.4µs / 375ns.
   The cold fast path (bounded linear scan of raw entry sections, then dladdr)
   is a transitional mechanism; Go needs none of it because the linker ships a
   sorted table.
2. LTO inlining duplicates the body-embedded entry-site inline asm into every
   inline site: `llgo_funcinfo_entry` grew ~4x on the multipkg benchmark and
   host-function PCs get registered under the inlinee's symbol ID. IR-level
   fixes were tried and ruled out (see Facts below); dedup must happen after
   final code generation.
3. The runtime keeps ~300 lines of transitional complexity: cold lookup
   budget, section scans, first-use sort, entry-PC slack matching.
4. pcvalue-style instruction-level line tables (the next alignment step with
   Go) need a per-function table keyed by final text order.

## Approach: post-link table generation

Insert a post-link step into `internal/build` after the final clang/lld link:

```
link -> post-link tool: parse binary -> sort/dedup -> build buckets -> write back
```

A separate linker plugin was considered and rejected: llgo drives stock
clang/lld and a plugin would need to be maintained per linker flavor
(ld64.lld, ld.lld) and per LTO mode. Editing the linked artifact is
linker-agnostic.

### Function identity contract

PCLN is indexed by physical text functions, following Go's linker model.
Source functions and compiler-generated wrappers or adapters all contribute
ordinary function records and entry sites. The symbol names the physical
function; its display name may describe the corresponding Go operation.
Calling conventions, closure environments, and their transport mechanism are
not PCLN properties and must not introduce function-class-specific sections.

### Data flow

1. **Parse** the linked binary's metadata sections (`debug/elf`,
   `debug/macho` from the Go stdlib — the tool runs on the host):
   - `llgo_funcinfo_entry` / `__DATA,__llgo_fie` (Mach-O without physical
     compaction) / `__LLGO,__llgo_fie` (embedded executable LTO Mach-O):
     `{pc, symbolID}` records.
   - Zero records are skipped, as in the runtime today.
2. **Dedup by symbolID**: LTO inline copies register the same symbolID at
   several PCs. The true entry is the record whose PC lies inside the text
   range of the symbol that owns the symbolID; resolve via the binary's
   symbol table (`.symtab` / `nlist`). Records that fall inside a different
   function's range are inline copies — drop them. This is the fix for gap 2
   that IR-level metadata could not express.
3. **Sort** by PC; append a sentinel entry (end of text) so the runtime can
   use Go's forward-scan lookup shape (`internal/pclntab.LookupFuncIndex`).
4. **Build buckets** with `internal/pclntab.BuildFindFuncBuckets` — the
   faithful port of `cmd/link`'s algorithm that has been sitting unwired
   since #2012. Delta overflow is a hard error here, mirroring Go's linker;
   if it ever fires, fall back to leaving the prebuilt table absent.
5. **Write back and compact** the entry carrier:
   - The compact table replaces the prefix of `llgo_funcinfo_entry`; if it
     does not fit, the binary is left unchanged and the runtime uses its
     first-use construction fallback.
   - Embedded executable LTO Mach-O puts the entry carrier in a dedicated
     `__LLGO` segment. Non-LTO, external-PCLN, c-shared, and c-archive Mach-O
     keep it in `__DATA`: without a physical post-link compaction step, an
     isolated carrier makes arm64 output pay for an otherwise-unused 16 KiB
     file page. ELF links the carrier immediately before `.bss`, at the
     file-backed tail of the final writable `PT_LOAD`. PC-line sites remain
     outside the disposable range.
   - ELF compaction rejects an image with a program segment after the carrier;
     only non-loaded sections and the section-header table may be shifted.
   - After fixing Mach-O chained pointers, section sizes, load commands,
     segment offsets, ELF program/section headers, and link-edit offsets, the
     tool removes the unused carrier suffix from the physical file. Virtual
     addresses of program text/data do not move; the omitted tail becomes
     zero-fill memory.
   - Rewriting is transactional: construct and reopen the complete staged
     image, re-sign an originally signed Mach-O, then atomically rename it.
     An unfamiliar segment shape, overlapping relocation/fixup range, signing
     failure, or verification failure leaves the original executable intact.

### ASLR

Stored table entries are offsets from the first function PC. The header keeps
that base as a runtime address: Mach-O rewrites its slot into the dyld chained
fixup chain, while supported non-PIE ELF outputs already use their runtime
address. The lookup hot path therefore only adds the stored entry offset.

### Runtime integration

`initRuntimeFuncPCFramesOnce` gains a fast path: if the prebuilt header is
valid, adopt the table directly (no section scan, no sort, no bucket build)
— `FirstFuncForPC` becomes bucket-lookup cost, matching Go's shape. The
existing first-use construction remains as the fallback whenever the header
is invalid (older compilers, exotic formats, overflow bail-out), so the
change is strictly additive and safe to land incrementally.

## Staging

- **P1** `chore/pclnpost`: standalone tool, parse + dedup + sort + bucket
  build + stats printing; golden tests against binaries produced by the
  existing test programs. No behavior change.
- **P2** Reserve the section in `internal/build`, run the tool as a post-link
  step, wire the runtime fast path. Benchmarks: cold.FirstFuncForPC on both
  platforms; assert `llgo funcinfo: ... entries= prebuilt` via
  LLGO_FUNCINFO_DEBUG.
- **P3** (done) Mach-O bind-record resolution: pointer slots naming exported
  Go functions are chained-fixup BIND nodes, not rebases; without decoding
  them through the imports table, exported records miss the prebuilt ftab and
  `FuncForPC` silently pays a dladdr per fresh pc (~6µs). Also: the prebuilt
  header's base slot is spliced back into the fixup chain as a live rebase
  node, so the runtime reads a dyld-slid runtime PC directly (no slide
  arithmetic). Transitional cold budget/scan stays as the fallback for
  non-rewritten binaries.
- **P4** pcvalue-style line tables keyed by the prebuilt function order
  (replaces the call-site pcline records; gives instruction-level FileLine).

## Established facts (verified in #2012 work; do not re-derive)

- Mach-O metadata sections need `live_support` + one lowercase-`l`
  linker-private symbol per record; ld64/lld `-dead_strip` then drops records
  exactly with their function. Verified with lld 19.1.7, including LTO.
- Boundary symbols: ELF `__start_/__stop_`; Mach-O `section$start$SEG$SECT`
  referenced from IR needs the `\x01` verbatim-name prefix or LLVM prepends
  an underscore and the linker stops recognizing it.
- Visible (non-`L`) labels inside Mach-O function bodies split the function
  into atoms that the linker may reorder — assembler-local labels only.
- `!associated` affects only linker GC; IR-level GlobalDCE deletes such
  globals regardless, and `llvm.compiler.used` pins dead functions through
  the records' initializers. This is why records stay body-embedded inline
  asm and dedup happens post-link.
- Mach-O chained fixups encode anchors to exported symbols as BIND nodes
  (import ordinal + addend), even when the target is defined in the same
  image; only local-symbol anchors are rebases. Decode both.
- Adding fixup nodes does not pre-touch pages at load on modern macOS:
  dyld uses page-in linking (the kernel applies fixups lazily at first
  touch), so "sacrificial fixups to warm the table's pages" is not a
  viable optimization — measured no effect on first-lookup latency.
- `internal/pclntab` is a faithful port of Go 1.26's findfunctab generation
  and lookup (uint8 deltas, overflow error, forward scan, sentinel); the
  runtime's in-process variant deliberately uses uint16 deltas because LLGo
  lacks Go's MINFUNC guarantee. The post-link table can use the faithful
  uint8 layout since dedup restores the one-record-per-function invariant.
